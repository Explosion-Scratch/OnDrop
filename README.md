# FAQ

(Not actually asked frequently, this is just stuff that people may ask if they ever see this project and are interested in it :weary:)

## Why should I use this over other services?

- This doesn't track you, it's easy, you can share between platforms (Airdrop only works on macs & iPhones :computer:).
- Most other services track you somehow.

## How does OnDrop work?

OnDrop uses your [IP address](https://www.dummies.com/computers/pcs/what-is-an-ip-address/) to put you into a [room](https://socket.io/docs/v3/rooms/index.html) using [socket.io](https://socket.io). To send files in realtime it sends the file as a [blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) to a certain person. This file is then received by that person. All connections are hidden from IP addresses outside of the current group. To view the full code that I wrote see [`index.js`](https://github.com/Explosion-Scratch/ondrop/blob/master/index.js).

## Does OnDrop track you?

Absolutely not! All files are deleted after 5 minutes, and whenever I run the server. IP addresses are not tracked in any way, they are only used as a grouping tool to group people together.

## How'd you get that epic name?

## Wowww, I love those shadows and stuff you did

Thanks! That's a style called [neomorphism](https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6), which is a super cool way to make stuff look realistic and pleasant using CSS.

## All these other people you show are contacting you on discord and I feel left out

`--Explosion--#0001` :smile:

## How did you come up with this idea?

![Roll Safe, the Guy-Tapping-Head Meme](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d6a/dc7/4a5001b7beea096457f480c8808572428b-09-roll-safe.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg)
Came to me when I realized that multiple people can have the same IP address, therefore it'd be possible to group them and figure out who's near whom.

## Can I use your code?

It's open source, so sure, but give credit :neutral_face:

## Tips and tricks! Gimme some!

- You can click on a user to share a file with them.
- You can create a unique link to share with someone if they don't live nearby or aren't on the same wifi network by using the `ip` query parameter, (like this: `https://ondrop.explosionscratc.repl.co/?ip=test`, now if the person you send it to goes to that link you'll be able to connect)
- You can paste anything and it'll upload it to everyone, an image, some text, etc!
- You can drag and drop not just files, but images and text from webpages as well!
- Now installable as a PWA!
